# BANK_CUSTOMER_CHURN_MODEL
This repository hosts a predictive model for predicting customer churn in a bank.
## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn for a bank. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting customer churn can help banks take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical data about bank customers, including their transaction history, account details, and whether they churned or not. The dataset is not provided in this repository due to privacy concerns. However, you can obtain a similar dataset from [source link] or use your own data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryawaghmare/BANK_CUSTOMER_CHURN_MODEL.git
   cd BANK_CUSTOMER_CHURN_MODEL
